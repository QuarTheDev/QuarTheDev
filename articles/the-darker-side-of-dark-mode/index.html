      <p>There's no doubt that over the past few decades, technology has been advancing rapidly. Thanks to modern technology, various innovations have transformed the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. The web is no longer about who creates it, it's about the user. That is the fundamentals of UX, or User Experience. It's what makes a website easy to use and accessible for many.</p>
      <p>One example of those UX additions is dark mode. It's been slowly yet steadily becoming the norm. If you're like me, there's no doubt that you use dark mode in your daily life. It's become an essential tool worldwide, enabling users to customize the appearance of their digital interfaces by switching to a darker color scheme. Dark mode offers a multitude of benefits, including reduced eye strain, improved readability in low-light environments, and prolonged battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED screens.</p>
      <p>As technology continues to evolve, it's important to recognize dark mode as more than just a trend or aesthetic preference. It has become an accessibility feature that caters to diverse user needs. For individuals with visual impairments or conditions, dark mode can significantly enhance their digital experiences by reducing the glare and increasing the legibility. Furthermore, people who spend long hours in front of screens, such as professionals, students, and content creators, rely on dark mode to mitigate eye fatigue and maintain productivity.</p>
      <p>With a heavy heart, this is where I bring in applications like Snapchat, LinkedIn, and Waterminder. Platforms like these inadvertently inflame the challenges faced by individuals with impairments and disabilities, as they lock the very features designed to assist them behind an expensive monthly paywall.</p>
      <p>It is crucial for these platforms, along with others in the technology industry, to recognize their social responsibility in creating an accessible and equitable digital environment. By removing barriers and making essential features, like dark mode, universally accessible, we can ensure that individuals with these impairments and disabilities are empowered to navigate and engage with technology on an equal footing.</p>
      <p>I firmly believe that accessibility should be at the core of every digital offering. I encourage other platforms and developers to explore initiatives to implement accesility features such as dark mode. Together, let's strive for a digital world that celebrates diversity, embraces accessibility, and ensures equal opportunities for all.<3</p>
